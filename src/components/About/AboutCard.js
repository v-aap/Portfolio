              I am <span className="purple">Valeria Arce, </span>a passionate full-stack developer based in <span className="purple">Toronto, Canada.</span> My love for problem-solving and creativity led
              me to explore the world of web and app development, where I thrive on building digital solutions that
              simplify workflows and enhance user experience.

              <br />
              <br />
              I specialize in full-stack development with a strong focus on databases, web applications, and cloud-based
              solutions.
              <br />
              <br />
              I aspire to work on scalable applications that blend performance with great user experience while
              continuously learning and growing as a developer.
              <br />
              <br />
              Beyond coding, I enjoy activities that sharpen problem-solving skills and foster creativity:
